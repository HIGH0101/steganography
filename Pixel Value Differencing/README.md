# Pixel Value Differencing
Information hiding is the science of sending and embedding secret information using a cover media. steganography hides secret message in other objects known as cover object in a way that nothing can be percepted. Several steganographic algorithms have been proposed for
embedding data in digital images as cover media,One of the steganographic techniques is based on pixel value differencing (PVD) was proposed by Wu and Tsai. Unlike the popular least_significant bit (LSB), the PVD method adapts the number of embedded bits to the grayscale/color changes in consecutive pixels.
