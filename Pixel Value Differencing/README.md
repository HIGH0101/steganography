# Pixel Value Differencing
Steganography is the science of sending and embedding secret information using a cover media. By stefanography secret message is hidden in other objects known as cover object in a way that nothing can be percepted. Several steganographic algorithms have been proposed for
embedding data in digital images as cover media, One of the steganographic techniques is based on pixel value differencing (PVD) was proposed by Wu and Tsai. Unlike the popular least_significant bit (LSB), the PVD method adapts the number of embedded bits to the grayscale/color changes in consecutive pixels. To more information about PVD method, you can refer to [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865502004026)
